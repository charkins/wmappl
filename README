your 16x16 xpms in the /usr/local/share/pixmaps or specify the
appropriate location(s) on the command line. The following
command would search both /home/casey/.icons/ and /usr/local/share/wmappl/
for icons. All icons specified are first tried as absolute paths.

	wmappl --iconpath /home/casey/.icons/:/usr/local/share/wmappl


	If you used installed the icons that came with wmappl, they
were installed in the directory /usr/share/icons/wmappl. This directory
is in the search path by default.
